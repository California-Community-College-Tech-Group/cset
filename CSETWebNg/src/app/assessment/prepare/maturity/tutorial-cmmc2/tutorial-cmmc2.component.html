        <h4>1. CMMC 2.0 Tutorial for CSETÂ® </h4>

        <div class="mb-5">
          <h5>Overview</h5>

          <p>
            The CMMC framework consists of the security requirements from NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2, Protecting Controlled
            Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations, and a subset of the requirements from NIST
            SP
            800-172, Enhanced Security Requirements for Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information: A Supplement to
            NIST
            Special Publication 800-171. The model framework organizes these practices into a set of domains, which map
            directly to the NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 families.There are three levels within CMMC-Level 1, Level 2, and
            Level
            3-as described in the sections below.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-5">
          <h5>CMMC Levels</h5>

          <p>
            The CMMC model measures the implementation of cybersecurity requirements at three levels. Each level
            consists
            of
            a set of CMMC practices:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Level 1: Encompasses the basic safeguarding requirements for FCI specified in FAR Clause 52.204-21.</li>
            <li>Level 2: Encompasses the security requirements for CUI specified in NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 per DFARS
              Clause
              252.204-7012 [3, 4, 5].</li>
            <li>Level 3: Information on Level 3 will be released at a later date and will contain a subset of the
              security
              requirements specified in NIST SP 800-172 [6].</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The CMMC levels and associated sets of practices across domains are cumulative. More specifically, for an
            organization to achieve a specific CMMC level, it must also demonstrate achievement of the preceding lower
            levels. For the case in which an organization does not meet its targeted level, it will be certified at the
            highest level for which it has achieved all applicable practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Level 1 focuses on the protection of FCI and consists of only practices that correspond to the basic
            safeguarding requirements specified in 48 CFR 52.204-21, commonly referred to as the FAR Clause [3].

          <h5>CMMC Practices</h5>

          <h6>Overview</h6>

          <p>
            The CMMC model measures the implementation of the NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 [4] security requirements. The
            practices
            originate from the safeguarding requirements and security requirements specified in FAR Clause 52.204-21 [3]
            and
            DFARS Clause 252.204-7012 [5], respectively.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Level 1 is equivalent to all of the safeguarding requirements from FAR Clause 52.204-21.</li>
            <li> Level 2 is equivalentto all of the security requirements in NIST SP 800-171 Revision 2.</li>
            <li>Level 3 will be based on a subset of NIST SP 800-172 and more detailed information will be released at a
              later date.</li>
          </ul>



          <h6>List of Practices</h6>

          <p>
            This subsection itemizes the practices for each domain and at each level. Each practice has a practice
            identification number in the format &mdash; <strong>DD.L#-REQ</strong> &mdash; where:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>DD is the two-letter domain abbreviation;</li>
            <li>L# is the level number; and</li>
            <li>REQ is the NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 or NIST SP 800-172 security requirement number.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Below the identification number, a short name identifier is provided for each practice, meant to be used for
            quick reference only. Finally, each practice has a complete practice statement.

        <h4>2. Scoping</h4>

        <h5>Level 1 Self-Assessment Scope</h5>

        <p>
          Prior to a Level 1 Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Self-Assessment, the contractor must
          specify the CMMC Self-Assessment Scope. The CMMC Self-Assessment Scope informs which assets within the
          contractor's environment will be assessed and the details of the self-assessment.
        </p>

        <h6>
          FCI Assets
        </h6>
        <p>
          Federal Contract Information (FCI) Assets process, store, or transmit FCI as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Process - FCI can be used by an asset (e.g., accessed, entered, edited, generated, manipulated, or
            printed).
          </li>
          <li>Store - FCI is inactive or at rest on an asset (e.g., located on electronic media, in system component
            memory, or in physical format such as paper documents).</li>
          <li>Transmit - FCI is being transferred from one asset to another asset (e.g., data in transit using physical
            or
            digital transport methods).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          FCI Assets are part of the CMMC Self-Assessment Scope and are assessed against applicable CMMC practices.
        </p>

          Additional Guidance on Level 1 Scoping Activities
        </h6>
        <p>
          To appropriately scope a CMMC Level 1 self-assessment, the contractor should consider the people, technology,
          facilities, and external service providers within their environment that process, store, or transmit FCI.

            Scope Level 2 Version 2.0 December 2021</a> provides
          information on the <strong>categorization of assets</strong> that, in turn, inform the specification of
          assessment scope for a
          Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) assessment. The scoping guide discusses CMMC asset
          categories as well as the associated requirements for Defense Industrial Base (DIB) contractors and CMMC
          assessments.

            Level 2 Version 2.0 December 2021</a> maps contractor assets into one of five
          categories. <strong>Table 1 in the Assessment Guide</strong> describes each asset category, contractor
          requirements, and
          assessment requirements. Additional information about each asset category is provided in the ensuing sections.

        <h6>
          Defining the CMMC Assessment Scope
        </h6>
        <p>
          After categorizing their assets, the contractor then specifies the CMMC Assessment Scope. See the <a
