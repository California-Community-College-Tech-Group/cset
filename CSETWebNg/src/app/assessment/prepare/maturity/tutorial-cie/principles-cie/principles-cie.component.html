    <h2>Cyber-Informed Engineering Principles</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>CIE is an engineering approach that integrates cybersecurity considerations into the conception, design, build, and operation of any physical system that has digital connectivity, sensors, monitoring, or control.</strong>
      Rather than rely exclusively on cybersecurity controls, CIE offers the opportunity to add engineering mitigations to eliminate or mitigate avenues for cyber-attack—starting from the earliest stage of design and continuing throughout the system’s lifecycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, engineers and industrial control system (ICS) technicians build energy systems with specific goals for safety, reliability, and functionality. While systems engineering includes considerable safety and failure mode analysis, cybersecurity risks are often not specifically addressed as potential causes of such failures—particularly the risks of intentional cyber compromise, exploitation, and misuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply put, traditional engineering risk management approaches rarely address the risks of directed, purposeful system manipulation or disruption performed by an intelligent and capable cyber adversary. Instead, cyber risk management is conducted by cybersecurity teams, who are called in only after system components are selected to harden the integration of those components. This process delays the introduction of cybersecurity mitigations until late in the engineering lifecycle, providing inadequate and more costly protection for the nation’s energy infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      CIE aims to shift the way the nation’s engineers, ICS technicians, manufacturers, and operators approach security in energy systems design. 
      <strong>This approach offers new opportunities to “engineer out” cyber risk—that is, to adapt physical design and engineering controls to reduce, mitigate, and even eliminate the consequences of a cyber-attack. </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Researchers first began to define a <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1369373" target="_blank">CIE approach in 2017</a>, identifying a set of principles to consider when solving an engineering problem. In the intervening years, those principles have been refined and revised, and the Implementation Guide offers the most current and granular identification of CIE principles to date. The principles identified here are not exhaustive but do serve as important elements within an ICS engineering risk-management process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Implementation Guide provides a deep discussion of each principle, and the questions and considerations an engineering team must address to embody the principle in their resulting system. </strong> Those questions and considerations are presented for each phase in the system lifecycle.
