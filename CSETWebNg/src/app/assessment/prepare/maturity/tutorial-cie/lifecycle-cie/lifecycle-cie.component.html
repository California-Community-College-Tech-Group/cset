    <h2>Systems Engineering Lifecycle Model for CIE</h2>
    <p>
      As a project progresses from initial concept, through design and ultimately implementation, 
      the design team has different opportunities to identify, implement, and verify cyber protections 
      and mitigations appropriate for the system. The Implementation Guide presents each CIE principle 
      for each phase of the engineering lifecycle. By considering CIE through a systems-engineering perspective, 
      rather than as principles alone, practitioners can understand how the application of CIE changes 
      through a project’s lifecycle. This approach encourages more thorough upfront work for requirements, 
      design, and stakeholder coordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide offers considerations to practically apply CIE principles at each lifecycle phase. 
      The team considered several systems engineering models to use as a basis for the 
      Implementation Guide, but they found that many models were either too granular or too industry- 
      or system-specific to adopt directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guide uses an engineering lifecycle model that simplifies the lifecycle into seven core 
      systems engineering phases, with three controlling processes that occur across all phases 
      (project management, risk management, and change/configuration management).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>This model offers several benefits:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple enough to identify discrete CIE considerations at each phase</li>
      <li>Focused broadly on systems engineering, rather than specifically on software engineering</li>
      <li>Can be flexibly adapted to a variety of common engineering lifecycle models</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Engineers should be able to align each phase in the Implementation Guide with one or more phases 
      in their own preferred systems engineering model and apply the guidance at each relevant phase.

    <h2>Lifecycle Models Considered</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Extensive literature review identified four lifecycle models for initial consideration, including the 
        <a href="https://www.incose.org/docs/default-source/los-angeles/libraryresources/se-jr-handdbook-2015.pdf?sfvrsn=1d3c80c6_2" target="_blank">INCOSE project lifecycle model</a>,
        <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/cioprod/documents/SEM3_1231.pdf" target="_blank">DOE project lifecycle model</a>,
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v1r1" target="_blank">NIST Systems Security Engineering Framework</a>,
        and the <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/cadiv/segb/files/segbversion3.pdf" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT) Vee Technical Development</a>. 
        Although each model provided unique benefits and perspectives, the DoT model was selected as the structure for primary 
        mapping because of its significant level of detail around its phases. Further, the DoT model’s terminology 
        aligns most closely with that of industrial/energy infrastructure system design.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Implementation Guide development team initially chose this model for use in the Implementation Guide because it 
        offers the following attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Includes a conceptual design phase (concept exploration and concept of operations), which is important for early inclusion and application of CIE principles.</li>
        <li>Includes clear, cross-cutting activities (creation and execution of validation, verification, and test plans) to which CIE principles and decisions/designs/ requirements derived through the application of CIE principles can be included. Cross-cutting activities ensure that CIE-driven system requirements and designs are both included in the final system design and achieve their intended purpose.</li>
        <li>Includes a maintenance and operations lifecycle phase to ensure CIE principles are considered for the entire operational life of the system. This also helps ensure technicians have a role in the application of CIE. </li>
        <li>Includes a changes and upgrades phase so that CIE can be incorporated as designs, requirements, equipment, functions, etc. evolve over time.</li>
        <li>Includes a retirement/replacement/end of life phase.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        While the DoT model provided a valuable framework upon which to unpack CIE’s principles against the lifecycle 
        of a project, the development team ultimately determined that the framework was too granular. After conducting 
        an extensive mapping exercise across the entire DoT Vee and CIE’s principles, the team identified core phases 
        that apply synergistically to energy projects and have the flexibility to apply to other infrastructure that 
        includes physical processes with digital control.
