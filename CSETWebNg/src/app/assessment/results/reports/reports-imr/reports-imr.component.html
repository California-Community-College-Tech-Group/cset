               The report includes a wide array of charts and graphs designed to visually present and summarize the
               responses gathered throughout the assessment process, enabling organizations to analyze and assess their
               incident management capabilities effectively. Organizations can gauge if their incident management
               functions align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework
               (CSF), as assessment results are depicted in terms relative to the NIST CSF. Additionally, the report
               includes a compilation of all IMR practices along with their corresponding references.
