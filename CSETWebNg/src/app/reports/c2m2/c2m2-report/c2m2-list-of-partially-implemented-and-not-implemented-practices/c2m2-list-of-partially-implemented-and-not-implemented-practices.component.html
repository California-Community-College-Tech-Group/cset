<h1>7. List of Partially Implemented and Not Implemented Practices</h1>
<p>
  Practices that received a response of Partially Implemented or Not Implemented are consolidated in this section and
  shown with any notes captured during the self-evaluation. If an organization is targeting a MIL in a specific domain,
  these tables will highlight the practices the organization must prioritize to achieve the target MIL.
</p>
<p>
  The tables in this section are ordered first by MIL, then further ordered by the implementation response for practices
  at that MIL, with Partially Implemented practices followed by Not Implemented practices. This highlights the practices
  that may be the focus of improvement efforts to reach a MIL target in each domain.
