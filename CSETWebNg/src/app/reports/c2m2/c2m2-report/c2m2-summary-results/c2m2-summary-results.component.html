<h1>3.2 Practice Implementation by Domain</h1>
<p>
  Figure 3 shows summarized implementation level responses for each C2M2 practice, grouped by domain. The MIL achieved for
  each domain is listed at the bottom of the figure. A MIL is achieved when all practices in that MIL and all preceding
  MILs receive responses of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented. A high-level understanding of the organization’s
  self-evaluation results can be gained from this figure and may be useful when evaluating areas for future improvement.
</p>
<p>
  The number in the center of each donut chart represents the cumulative number of practices in that MIL for that domain.
  Refer to Section 4.2 of the C2M2 V2.1 model document for a description of how MIL achievement is determined.

<h1>3.3 Implementation of Management Activities across Domains</h1>
<p>
  The final objective of each C2M2 domain includes practices focused on cybersecurity management activities. These
  practices focus on the extent to which cybersecurity practices are institutionalized, or ingrained, in the
  organization’s operations. The more deeply ingrained an activity, the more likely it is that the organization will
  continue to perform the activity over time; the activity will be retained under times of stress; and the outcomes of the
  activity will be consistent, repeatable, and of high quality. Table 2 provides a high-level overview of implementation
  of the Management Activities practices from two perspectives: 1) implementation of all Management Activities within each
  domain and 2) implementation of each Management Activities practice across the ten C2M2 domains.
