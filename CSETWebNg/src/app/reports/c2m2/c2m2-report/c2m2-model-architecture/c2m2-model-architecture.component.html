<h1>2. Model Architecture</h1>
<p>
  The model is organized into 10 domains. Each domain is a logical grouping of cybersecurity practices. The practices
  within a domain are grouped by objectiveâ€”target achievements that support the domain. Within each objective, the
  practices are ordered by maturity indicator levels (MILs).
</p>
<p>
  The following sections include additional information about the domains and the MILs.
</p>

<h2>2.1 Domains, Objectives, and Practices</h2>
<p>
  The C2M2 includes 356 cybersecurity practices, which are grouped into 10 domains. These practices represent the
  activities an organization can perform to establish and mature capability in the domain. For example, the Asset, Change,
  and Configuration Management domain is a group of practices that an organization can perform to establish and mature
  asset management, change management, and configuration management capabilities.
</p>
<p>
  The practices within each domain are organized into objectives, which represent achievements that support the domain.
  For example, the Asset, Change, and Configuration Management domain comprises five objectives:
</p>
<ol class="mb-3">
  <li>Manage IT and OT Asset Inventory</li>
  <li>Manage Information Asset Inventory</li>
  <li>Manage IT and OT Asset Configurations</li>
  <li>Manage Changes to IT and OT Assets</li>
  <li>Management Activities for the ASSET domain</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Each of the objectives in a domain comprises a set of practices, which are ordered by MIL. Figure 1 summarizes the
  elements of each domain.
