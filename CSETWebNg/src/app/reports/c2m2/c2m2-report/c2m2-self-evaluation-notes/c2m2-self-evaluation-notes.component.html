<h1>6. Self-Evaluation Notes</h1>
<p>
  This section lists all practices for which notes were captured during the self-evaluation, regardless of implementation
  status. Reviewing the notes may provide the rationale for the selection of an implementation response during the
  completion of the self-evaluation. The tables in this section are ordered by model practice identifier.
