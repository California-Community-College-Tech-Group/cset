            Impact category is the classification of where a particular impact 
            may happen if a cyber attack were to occur. The breakdown of the 
            chart is by domain, with different categories that we have defined 
            as most applicable to this assessment: Economic, Environmental, 
            Operational, and Safety. {{facilityName}} can see the breakdown of how 
            the answers of the assessment relate to what potential impacts the 
            facility may have in case of a cyberattack.
