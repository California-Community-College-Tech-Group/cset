<h1>Importance of Cybersecurity Assessments</h1>
<p>
    The rapid migration of the public and private sector to a digital economy has made the 
    risk of cyber-attacks extremely high in recent years. The business continuity of an 
    enterprise is now strongly dependent on the strength of its cybersecurity controls, 
    cybersecurity awareness of its employees and contractors and standard business processes 
    that minimize exposure to attacks. The cost to an organization for a cybersecurity incident 
    on a critical hydropower system can include direct Ô¨Ånancial loss, physical damage, severe 
    reputation impact, and even loss of life. These consequences influence other impact categories 
    such as environmental, economic, safety, and operational. Hydropower plants face numerous 
    challenges in making informed decisions in managing upgrades and maintaining systems to ensure 
    continuity of operations. Regular cybersecurity assessments that enable a risk-based approach 
    to allocating resources and improving the overall cybersecurity posture of the organization is 
    paramount in ensuring the security and resiliency of hydropower facilities. CVF was built to 
    enable a comprehensive and periodic cybersecurity risk assessment that informs investment decisions. 
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks serve as reference guides 
    in building the CVF assessment structure as well as the scoring methodology.

    detailed analysis of weak points categorized by CVF assessment, as well as their domains and subdomains.
