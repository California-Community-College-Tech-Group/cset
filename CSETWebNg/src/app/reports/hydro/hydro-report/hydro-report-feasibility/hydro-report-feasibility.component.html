            Feasibility is defined as how much resources will it take 
            to implement a particular control. It is broken down into 
            three different tiers: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Easy means 
            that the control will require no existing process, and cost 
            little to no money to implement. Medium means that a control 
            will require multiple inputs from multiple personnel and may 
            cost a significant amount. High means that a control will require 
            a significant lift requiring multiple inputs from personnel 
            and require a significant cost. {{facilityName}} can see how their 
            facility breaks down in terms of how difficult controls will be to implement.
