<h1>Results Summary</h1>
<p>
    {{facilityName}} completed the cybersecurity valuation assessment on {{completionDate}}. 
    The Value-at-Risk score from the assessment was Moderate necessity to invest resources 
    (workforce/funding/tools) to mitigate associated risks with score: {{riskScore}}. 
    This score is calculated by the CVF application based on the collective responses from 
    the {{facilityName}} representatives that participated in the assessment. This suggests 
    that the {{facilityName}} cybersecurity Value-at-Risk (VaR) score is at a {{varNecessity}} 
    necessity to invest resources (workforce/funding/tools) to mitigate associated risks with 
    score: {{riskScore}} and there is opportunity for considerable improvement over the next 
    6-12 months across multiple domains if the actions described in Appendix B are completed. 
    Below is a summary of the four posture levels based on VaR score (where lower scores are better):
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 5%">
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Low: </span>
        <span>
            The facility has a stronger posture with some room for improvements. 
            There is a lower need to invest resources (workforce/funding/tools).
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Moderate: </span>
        <span>
            The facility has a good foundation in terms of cybersecurity practices. 
            There is a moderate need to invest resources (workforce/funding/tools) 
            and management should prioritize resource allocation accordingly to mitigate associated risks.
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">High: </span>
        <span>
            A weak foundation in cybersecurity practices. There is a higher need 
            to invest resources (workforce/funding/tools) and management should 
            prioritize resource allocation accordingly to mitigate associated risks.
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Extreme: </span>
        <span>
            There are no cybersecurity practices in place. There is an extreme 
            need to invest resources (workforce/funding/tools) and management 
            should prioritize resource allocation accordingly to mitigate associated risks.

    <h4>What is affecting my score?</h4>
    <p>
        Itâ€™s critical to understand the immediate shortcomings of your cybersecurity score. 
        This is caused by a combination of unanswered questions, which inhibit the potential 
        to score points, and weak answers to questions with a high impact. Impact is defined 
        as the importance a particular control has the rest of your security posture, and 
        are categorized by low, medium, or high. Medium and high impact designated controls 
        will have a greater impact on your score if not implemented.
