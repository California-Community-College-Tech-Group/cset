    <p>
      The Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) can help organizations of all sectors, types, and sizes to evaluate and make improvements to their cybersecurity programs and strengthen their operational resilience. This report presents the results of a C2M2 self-evaluation. The results included in this report may be used to measure and improve an existing cybersecurity program. It also may serve as an input for other activities, such as informing cybersecurity risk managers about the controls in place to mitigate cybersecurity risks within an organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results presented in this report are based on participant responses describing the degree to which C2M2 practices are implemented. This report may include sensitive information and should be protected accordingly.

    <h1 class="pagebreak-before">2. Model Architecture</h1>
		<p>
  		The model is organized into 10 domains. Each domain is a logical grouping of cybersecurity practices. The practices
  		within a domain are grouped by objective—target achievements that support the domain. Within each objective, the
  		practices are ordered by maturity indicator levels (MILs).
		</p>
		<p>
  		The following sections include additional information about the domains and the MILs.
		</p>

		<h1 class="pagebreak-before" id="toc-domains-objectives-practices">2.1 Domains, Objectives, and Practices</h1>
		<p>
  		The C2M2 includes 356 cybersecurity practices, which are grouped into 10 domains. These practices represent the activities an organization can perform to establish and mature capability in the domain. For example, the Asset, Change, and Configuration Management domain is a group of practices that an organization can perform to establish and mature asset management, change management, and configuration management capabilities.
		</p>
		<p>
  		The practices within each domain are organized into objectives, which represent achievements that support the domain. For example, the Asset, Change, and Configuration Management domain comprises five objectives:
		</p>
		<ol class="mb-3">
  		<li>Manage IT and OT Asset Inventory</li>
  		<li>Manage Information Asset Inventory</li>
  		<li>Manage IT and OT Asset Configurations</li>
  		<li>Manage Changes to IT and OT Assets</li>
  		<li>Management Activities for the ASSET domain</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
  		Each of the objectives in a domain comprises a set of practices, which are ordered by MIL. Figure 1 summarizes the
  		elements of each domain.

      For a more in-depth description of the C2M2 domains, refer to the C2M2 V2.1 model document
      available here: <a href="https://energy.gov/C2M2" target="_blank">https://energy.gov/C2M2</a>.
    </p>

    <h1 class="pagebreak-before" id="toc-maturity-indicator-levels">2.2 Maturity Indicator Levels</h1>
    <p>
      The model defines four maturity indicator levels (MILs), MIL0 through MIL3, which apply independently to each domain in
      the model. The MILs define a dual progression of maturity: an approach progression and a management progression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four aspects of the MILs are important for understanding and applying the model:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The maturity indicator levels apply independently to each domain. As a result, an organization using the model may be
        operating at different MIL ratings in different domains. For example, an organization could be operating at MIL1 in one
        domain, MIL2 in another domain, and MIL3 in a third domain.
      </li>
      <li>
        The MILs—MIL0 through MIL3—are cumulative within each domain. To earn a MIL in a given domain, an organization must
        perform all of the practices in that level and its predecessor level. For example, an organization must perform all of
        the domain practices in MIL1 and MIL2 to achieve MIL2 in the domain. Similarly, the organization must perform all
        practices in MIL1, MIL2, and MIL3 to achieve MIL3.
      </li>
      <li>
        Establishing a target MIL for each domain is an effective strategy for using the model to guide cybersecurity program
        improvement. Organizations should become familiar with the practices in the model prior to determining target MILs.
        Then, they can focus gap analysis activities and improvement efforts on achieving those target levels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Practice performance and MIL achievement need to align with business objectives and the organization's cybersecurity
        program strategy. Striving to achieve the highest MIL in all domains may not be optimal. Companies should evaluate the
        costs of achieving a specific MIL versus its potential benefits. However, the model was designed so that all companies,
        regardless of size, should be able to achieve MIL1 across all domains.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For a more in-depth description of the C2M2 MILs and the concept of dual progression, refer to the
      C2M2 V2.1 model document available here: <a href="https://energy.gov/C2M2" target="_blank">https://energy.gov/C2M2</a>.
    </p>

    <h1 class="pagebreak-before" id="toc-maturity-indicator-level-scoring">2.3 Maturity Indicator Level Scoring</h1>
    <p>
      MIL achievement scores are derived from responses entered into the C2M2 Self-Evaluation Tool. Responses are chosen from
      a four-point scale: Fully Implemented (FI), Largely Implemented (LI), Partially Implemented (PI), and Not Implemented
      (NI). A MIL is achieved when all practices in that MIL and all preceding MILs receive responses of Fully Implemented or
      Largely Implemented. A MIL is not achieved if any practices in that MIL or a preceding MIL have received a response of
      Partially Implemented or Not Implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, achieving a MIL in a domain requires the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Responses of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented for all practices in that MIL</li>
      <li>Responses of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented for all practices in all preceding MILs in that domain</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For example, to achieve MIL1 in a domain with four MIL1 practices, all four MIL1 practices have responses of Fully
      Implemented or Largely Implemented. To achieve MIL2 in that same domain, all MIL1 and MIL2 practices must have responses
      of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descriptions for self-evaluation response options are shown in the following table.

      3.3 Implementation of Management Activities across Domains
    </h1>
    <p>
      The final objective of each C2M2 domain includes practices focused on cybersecurity management activities. These
      practices focus on the extent to which cybersecurity practices are institutionalized, or ingrained, in the
      organization's operations. The more deeply ingrained an activity, the more likely it is that the organization will
      continue to perform the activity over time; the activity will be retained under times of stress; and the outcomes of the
      activity will be consistent, repeatable, and of high quality. Table 2 provides a high-level overview of implementation
      of the Management Activities practices from two perspectives: 1) implementation of all Management Activities within each
      domain and 2) implementation of each Management Activities practice across the ten C2M2 domains.
