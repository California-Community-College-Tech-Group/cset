                In consideration of Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d), the
                features and functions in this application have been developed to support users with
                accessibility requirements. Industry best practices and standards have guided our design
                and development processes to incorporate accessibility features built into the Windows
                operating system and the .NET architecture, as well as the Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
                browsers. The software development team is committed to integrating accessible
                design thinking throughout the entire product development cycle.
                More information on Section 508 and the technical standards can be found
                at <a href="https://www.section508.gov">www.section508.gov</a>.

            <h5>Adobe Acrobat PDF Files</h5>
            <p class="w-100">
                Many of the documents in this application are in HTML or ASCII (plain text) formats.
                These formats are generally accessible to people who use screen readers. We also have
                a large number of documents in Adobe Acrobat® Portable Document Format (PDF).
                When using a screen reader to read documents directly in PDF format using Adobe
                Acrobat Reader, you will likely need to install an accessibility plug-in. This plug-in is
                available free of charge on the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/trust/accessibility.html">Adobe
                    Accessibility</a> website.

            <h5>Our Section 508 Testing Efforts</h5>
            <p class="w-100">We believe that a trusted, effective, open-source cybersecurity tool should be readily
                available and accessible to all.</p>
            <p class="w-100">To ensure the most accessible experience for all of our users, in addition to the above
                Section 508 best practices, we regularly test our software for the following functionality:</p>
            <h6>Keyboard / Focus</h6>
            <p class="w-100">We test that all functionality can be accessed and executed using only the keyboard.</p>
            <h6>Forms</h6>
            <p class="w-100">We check to ensure that labels and instructions are provided for each form input and that
                each form label is sufficiently descriptive. We test the page to check that notifications are provided
                of each form-related change in content. We expect any errors to be identified in text and sufficiently
                described to the user, with additional guidance (e.g., suggestion for corrected input) provided about
                how to correct errors for form fields. Finally, our web page allows our user to check, reverse, and/or
                confirm submission.</p>
            <h6>Links / Buttons</h6>
            <p class="w-100">We test that each link and button can be determined from any combination of the link/button
                text, accessible name, accessible description, and/or programmatically determined context. We also check
                that the page provides notification of each change in content that is the result of interaction with a
                link or button.</p>
            <h6>Repetitive Content and Links</h6>
            <p class="w-100">We check the relative order of repeated components so they match with other pages.</p>
            <h6>Content Structure</h6>
            <p class="w-100">We test for functionality that each heading describes the topic or purpose of its content,
                and that each programmatically determinable heading is a visual heading. We want each visual heading to
                be programmatically determinable. We check for programmatic heading levels to logically match the visual
                heading presentation within the heading structure, so that all visually apparent lists are
                programmatically identified according to their type.</p>
            <h6>Language</h6>
            <p class="w-100">
                We check that the default human language of each Web page can be programmatically determined, and that
                any passage (content, image descriptions, form labels etc.) that differs from the default language of
                the page is identified correctly.
            </p>
            <h6>Page and Frame Titles</h6>
            <p class="w-100">We test to identify that a title element is defined for the web page, and that it
                identifies the contents or purpose of our page.</p>
            <h6>Color Dependence & Color Contrast</h6>
            <p class="w-100">We test to ensure that:
                <li>Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting
                    a
                    response, or distinguishing a visual element</li>
                <li>The visual presentation of text and images of text have sufficient contrast</li>
                <li>The text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 & Large-scale text and images has
                    ratio of at least 3:1</li>
                <li>Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory
                    characteristics of components, such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound</li>
            </p>
            <h6>Images</h6>
            <p class="w-100">The accessible name and description for a meaningful image provides an equivalent
                description of the image.</p>
            <h6>Resize Text</h6>
            <p class="w-100">We check for functionality to resize, scale, or zoom in on the text to at least 200% of its
                original size without loss of content or performance.</p>
            <h6>Multiple Ways</h6>
            <p class="w-100">We work to make sure our users find information is available using more than one way to
                locate the web page so they can find information quickly.</p>
            <h6>Error Identification</h6>
            <p class="w-100">We test that when an error is detected, an alert is displayed with text describing the
                error.</p>
            <h6>CSS Style</h6>
            <p class="w-100">This accessibility feature does not apply to our software.</p>
            <h6>Data Tables</h6>
            <p class="w-100">We check that data tables’ row or column headers are identified programmatically, data
                cells are associated with relevant headers, and that the layout table does not include structural
                attributes.</p>
            <h6>All interactive elements</h6>
            <p class="w-100">
                We check that interactive interface elements with multiple statuses indicate a current status, and that
                an input form role reflects its function accurately so any input text fields will have the correct
                value.
            </p>
            <h6>The following accessibility features do not apply to our software:</h6>
            <p class="w-100">
                <li>Autoplay/update</li>
                <li>Flashing</li>
                <li>Adjustable time limits</li>
                <li>Video-Audio only</li>
                <li>Multimedia</li>
                <li>Time Outs</li>
                <li>Required Plug-ins</li>
                <li>Alternative Version</li>
