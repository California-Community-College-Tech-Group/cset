#What is CSET?
The Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET) is a free software tool that helps users identify vulnerabilities in an organization's enterprise and industrial control cyber systems. CSET uses a hybrid risk and standards-based approach to evaluate the cybersecurity of a system and provide recommendations for improvement. 

CSET runs in Windows on a laptop or desktop computer.  It can also be configured to run in a client-server architecture.
