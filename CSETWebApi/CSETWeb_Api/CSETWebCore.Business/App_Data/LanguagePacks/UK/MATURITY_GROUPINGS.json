Relationship Formation includes understanding the acquirer’s critical services, having a process for entering into formal relationships, and evaluating external entities. A key aspect of Relationship Formation is identifying resilience requirements as the basis for risk management and formal agreements. Resilience requirements typically focus on integrity, confidentiality, and availability, but can also include other requirements important to the critical service."
