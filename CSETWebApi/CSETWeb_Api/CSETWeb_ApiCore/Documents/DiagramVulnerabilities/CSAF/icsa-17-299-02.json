          "text": "Key reinstallation attacks (\u201cKRACK\u201d) work against the four-way handshake of the WPA2 protocol. KRACK takes advantage of the retransmission of a handshake message to prompt the installation of the same encryption key every time it receives message 3 from the access point. Retransmission of the handshake message from the access point occurs if a proper client acknowledgement is not received to the initial message; retransmission resets the nonce value and replay counter to their initial values. A malicious actor could force these nonce resets by replaying the appropriate handshake message, which could allow for injection and decryption of arbitrary packets, hijacking of TCP connections, injection of HTTP content, or replaying of unicast or multicast data frames on the targeted device.CVE-2017-13082 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N).",
