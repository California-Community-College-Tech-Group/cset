If an attacker has persistent physical access to a CARTO 3 V4 System, the attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities in the operating system. This could allow the attacker to access information stored in the device, including individually identified health information about patients, affect the integrity of CARTO 3, or deny availability of the device. If the CARTO 3 V4 System is networked, an attacker with persistent physical access may also be able to access other systems within the user\u2019s network.",
