          "text": "An authenticated local path traversal vulnerability exists in the ArubaOS web-based management interface and CLI. This vulnerability only affects physical hardware controllers such as the 9000 series and 7x00 series. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires physical access to the controller and results in the ability to impact the integrity and confidentiality of critical files on the underlying operating system. This allows an attacker to impact the availability of the ArubaOS instance and may allow for modification or disclosure of sensitive data.CVE-2021-37733 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).",
