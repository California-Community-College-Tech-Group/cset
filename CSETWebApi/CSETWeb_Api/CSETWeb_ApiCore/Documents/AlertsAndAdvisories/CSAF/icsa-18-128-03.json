However, an attacker must be able to generate a certificate that results for the validation algorithm in a checksum identical to a trusted certificate.CVE-2018-4849 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).",
