</p>
<p>
    Determine how much of your organization&#8217;s operations are dependent on IT. Consider how much
    your organization relies on information technology to conduct business and make it a part of your culture to
    plan for contingencies in the event of a cyber incident. Identify and prioritize your organization&#8217;s
    critical assets and the associated impacts to operations if an incident were to occur. Ask the questions that
    are necessary to understanding your security planning, operations, and security-related goals. Develop an
    understanding of how long it would take to restore normal operations. Resist the &#8220;it can&#8217;t happen
    here&#8221; pattern of thinking. Instead, focus cyber risk discussions on &#8220;what-if&#8221; scenarios and
    develop an incident response plan to prepare for various cyber events and scenarios.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Lead development of an incident response plan outlining roles and responsibilities. Test it often.
    Incident response plans and disaster recovery plans are crucial to information security, but they are separate
    plans. Incident response mainly focuses on information asset protection, while disaster recovery plans focus on
    business continuity.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Having a defined process for identifying, analyzing, responding to, and learning from incidents that
    interrupt an organization&#8217;s operations provides consistent response to cybersecurity incidents and ensures
    that objectives are met when handling an incident. Without a defined process, an organization&#8217;s incident
    response might omit actions that the organization considers important. An incident management plan describes how
    the organization will respond to cybersecurity incidents. The objective of the plan should be translated into
    specific actions assigned to individuals or groups to perform when an incident occurs.
</p>
<p>
    <b>The incident response plan should address, at a minimum:</b>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        the organization&#8217;s approach to incident management<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        the structure of the incident management process<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        the requirements and objectives of the incident management process<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        a description of how the organization will identify events, triage and analyze incidents,
        respond and recover from incidents, and improve its response capabilities over time<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        the roles and responsibilities (including establishing key stakeholders) necessary to carry
        out the plan<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        applicable training needs and requirements<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        resources that will be required to meet plan objectives<br>

        </p>


        <p>
            Clearly defined system boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments.
            Such risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational
            operations, organizational assets, and individuals based on the operation and use of organizational systems.
            Risk assessments also consider risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractor operating
            systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational system/n/n/n/ns, outsourcing
            entities).
            Risk assessments, either formal or informal, can be conducted at the organization level, the mission or
            business process level, or the system level, and at any phase in the system development life cycle.
        </p>


        <p>
            NIST SP 800-30 provides guidance on conducting risk assessments.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
                FURTHER DISCUSSION
            </b>
        </p>

        <p><i>NOTE: This section is derived from CMMC 1.02 guidance for informational purposes only. It will be
                updated when the CMMC 2.0 publications become available.</i></p>

        <p>
            Risk arises from anything that can reduce an organization''s assurance of
            mission/business success; cause harm to image or reputation; or harm individuals, other organizations,
            or the Nation.</p>



        <p>Organizations assess the risk to their operations and assets at regular
            intervals [a]. Areas where weakness or vulnerabilities could lead to risk may include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>poorly designed and executed business processes;</li>
            <li>inadvertent actions of people, such as disclosure or modification of
                information;</li>
            <li>intentional actions of people inside and outside the organization;</li>
            <li>failure of systems to perform as intended;</li>
            <li>failures of technology; and</li>
            <li>external events, such as natural disasters, public infrastructure and
                supply chain failures.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            When conducting risk assessments use established criteria and procedures. The
            results of formal risk assessments are documented. It is important to note that risk assessments differ
            from vulnerability assessments (see RM.2.142). A vulnerability assessment provides input to a risk
            assessment along with other information such as results from likelihood analysis and analysis of
            potential treat sources.</p>

        <p>
            Risk assessments should be performed at defined regular intervals [a]. Mission
            risks include anything that will keep an organization from meeting its mission. Function risk is
            anything that will prevent the performance of a function. Image and reputation risks refer to intangible
            risks that have value and could cause damage to potential or future trust relationships.<span
                class="s1">63</span></p>

        <p>
            This practice, RM.2.141, which requires periodically assessing the risk to
            organization systems, assets, and individuals, is a baseline Risk Management practice. RM.2.141 enables
            several other Risk Management practices (e.g., RM.2.143 and RM.3.146), as well as CA.2.159.

        </p>

        <p>
            You are a system administrator. You and your team members are working on a big
            government contract requiring you to store CUI. As part of your periodic (e.g., annual) risk assessment
            exercise, you evaluate the new risk involved with storing CUI [a,b]. When conducting the assessment you
            consider increased legal exposure, financial requirements of safeguarding CUI, potentially elevated
            attention from external attackers, and other factors. After determining how storing CUI affects your
            overall risk profile, you use that as a basis for a conversation on how that risk should be
            mitigated. </p>

<p>Centrally manage [<em>Assignment: organization-defined controls and related processes</em>]. </p>
<p><strong>Supplemental Guidance</strong></p>

<p>Central management refers to
    organization-wide management and implementation of selected controls and processes. This includes planning,
    implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed controls and
    processes. As the central management of controls is generally associated with the concept of common (inherited)
    controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of control implementations and management and the
    judicious use of organizational resources. </p>

<p>Centrally managed controls and processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of
    initial and ongoing authorizations to operate and as part of organizational continuous monitoring. </p>

<p>
    Automated tools (e.g., security information and event management tools or enterprise security monitoring and
    management tools) can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of information associated with centrally
    managed controls and processes. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities;
    alerting mechanisms; and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization.
</p>

<p>As part of the control selection processes, organizations determine the controls that may be suitable for
    central management based on resources and capabilities. It is not always possible to centrally manage every
    aspect of a control. </p>

<p>In such cases, the control can be treated as a hybrid control with the control managed and implemented
    centrally or at the system level. The controls and control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial
    central management include but are not limited to: AC-2(1), AC-2(2), AC-2(3), AC-2(4), AC-4(all), AC-17(1),
    AC-17(2), AC-17(3), AC-17(9), AC-18(1), AC-18(3), AC-18(4), AC-18(5), AC-19(4), AC-22, AC-23, AT-2(1), AT-2(2),
