The outcome or goal of the threat objective is to negatively impact the organization. Threat objective examples may include data manipulation, IP Theft, damage to property, denial of control, loss of safety, or operational outage. 
A threat profile for an asset may include one or more threat objectives which may change over time or in different situations. 
Threat objectives are contextual to the organization and the assets within the function. For example, an organization that does not process confidential data may not be concerned about data theft but may be very concerned about an incident that causes an operational outage. Additionally, threat actors may leverage multiple tactics or techniques like those defined in the MITRE ATT&CK frameworks (for Enterprise or Industrial Control Systems) to achieve their goals.

Tiers should be based on defined criteria, such as importance of the asset to the function (e.g., safety, criticality of the asset to the delivery of the function, scarcity of the asset, how dependent other assets are on this asset) or the sensitivity of the data stored or processed by the asset. Prioritizations should be documented and ideally be agreed on by all involved stakeholders. They also should be communicated throughout the organization for use in incident response, risk management, and other relevant activities.

Tools that are able to span physical, virtual, mobile, hybrid, and other technology environments should be considered to help ensure adequate coverage of IT and OT assets. These tools may be optimized for specific products. When selecting automation tools, stakeholders with adequate training and experience should be engaged early and careful consideration should be given to ensuring the appropriate fit between automation tools and the products they are intended to integrate with.
Data integrity tools (such as cryptographic checksums) may help in the detection of unauthorized changes to configuration settings, especially when managing virtualized assets. As an example of this, an organization may implement file integrity checks for virtualization platforms to be performed upon boot up and confirm that no unauthorized changes have occurred.

Cyber risk categories that no longer serve a purpose in the risk management process should also be removed. As the organization remediates the causes of risks, some cyber risk categories may become unnecessary or redundant.
Removing cyber risk categories and cyber risks once eliminated or impact is not material will help the organization more efficiently manage remaining risks. For example, the organization may remove a cyber risk related to an operating system if that operating system is no longer in use within the organization.

UPDATE [dbo].[MATURITY_QUESTIONS] SET [Supplemental_Info]=N'Once risks to the function are identified, the organization should decide how to respond to those risks. Response begins with assigning a risk disposition to each risk or risk category, that is, a statement of the organization’s intention for addressing the risk. For example, risk mitigation involves taking active steps to minimize the risk; risk transfer is the contractual shifting of a risk from one party to another through a contract, such as through an insurance policy, a liability waiver with a client, or an indemnification agreement with a supplier.
Risk responses should be developed as part of the risk management strategy. Risk responses can vary widely across organizations but typically include:
· risk avoidance—altering operations to avoid the risk while still providing the essential service
· risk acceptance—acknowledgment of the risk but consciously not taking any action (in essence, accepting the potential consequences of the risk)
· risk transfer—assigning the risk to a willing and able entity
· risk mitigation—taking active steps to minimize the risk
· risk monitoring—performing further research and deferring action on the risk until the need to address the risk is apparent
Organizational risk response selection processes should clarify that it is not necessary to mitigate every identified risk. Risk avoidance, acceptance, or transfer should be considered in addition to mitigation.

UPDATE [dbo].[MATURITY_QUESTIONS] SET [Supplemental_Info]=N'The requirements for credentials used to access the organization’s assets should be commensurate with the risk associated with the assets. If an organization uses a matrix for determining the potential impact and priority of risks, it may develop a companion matrix that specifies credential and authentication requirements for each level of impact. For example, for remote access to a system with risks that could result in significant impact (level 4 of 5) and a high likelihood of occurrence (level 4 of 5), a commensurate requirement might establish that personnel must use strong credentials, multifactor authentication, or single use credentials. In situations where strong credentials (such as MFA) may be warranted, but are precluded by technological limitations, consider implementing the strongest available authentication configurations and implementing compensating controls if deemed appropriate based on risk and operational considerations.
Multifactor authentication (MFA) involves the use of two or more factors to achieve verification of an identity. Factors include (1) something you know, such as a password, (2) something you have, such as a token, (3) something you are, such as a fingerprint, or (4) something that indicates you are where you say you are, such as a GPS token. For the example above, personnel could be required to authenticate using a login ID, a password, and a token. 
Single use credentials may be implemented through a privileged access management (PAM) solution. Functionality provided by a PAM include role-based access to privileged credentials, automated rotation of passwords, integration with MFA, and auditing of privileged credential use.

These are specific examples of access that may pose higher risk to the function: 
· privileged accounts
· service accounts
· shared accounts (Use of these should be discouraged in general, but not possible in certain legacy IT and OT assets, where additional controls are appropriate such as stronger credentials as mentioned in this practice, strong physical access controls, or others.)
· remote access
· administrative accounts
· emergency access
· access to sensitive assets
· access to cloud or virtual asset management systems
· cryptographic key management accounts
· backup accounts
(Note that as requirements for stronger or multifactor credentials are established for more of these types of access, the higher the organization moves on the spectrum of maturity.)
Additionally, it is important to note that the word risk is being used in this practice in the general sense of the word and not intended to refer to any specific risks identified in the Risk Management domain of the C2M2. However, organizations should consider access to IT and OT assets and the controls applied to that access during the risk identification, analysis and response activities discussed in the Risk Management domain.

An organization may implement this control by first monitoring last logon timestamp or other attributes to identify potential periods of inactivity.

For example, the logical access requirements for a specific asset might allow remote access by a vendor only during specified and preplanned maintenance intervals and might also require multifactor authentication for such access. As another example, it may be appropriate to apply additional logical access controls (such as peer review) to high-priority assets.
There are several models for access control, such as discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC), role-based access control (RBAC), policy-based access control (PBAC), and attribute-based access control (ABAC). Selection of an access control model will vary based on several factors, such as the operating environment and feasibility of implementation. For example, an organization may choose to implement an access control model that is supported by current infrastructure, such as RBAC, and plan for future implementation of a more advanced model, such as ABAC, as part of an acquisition of new infrastructure the supports additional access control capabilities.
Advanced security models, such as Zero Trust, may also inform the development of access requirements. For example, implementation of Zero Trust principles may include the ability to collect and use additional information (such as behavioral information, geolocation information, threat intelligence, and other contextual information) as part of access policy enforcement.

Defining predefined states of operation typically requires use of detailed architectures or topologies, documentation and detailed understanding of your assets and their priorities (ASSET-1c, ASSET-1d), categories (ASSET-2c, ASSET-2d), and attributes (ASSET-1e, ASSET-2e).
The defined states might include criteria for invoking the state, such as who has the authority to trigger a state change in either direction, checklists that must be completed before moving from a degraded state to an operational state, how long the organization can survive in a particular state, or how the organization will conduct monitoring to determine when the criteria are met. Information from monitoring activities is used to trigger decisions about invoking the predefined states of operation. 
For example, if monitoring activities indicate an outage, this might trigger a manual process in which some analysis is done that determines that not all operations can be supported, specific decision makers must sign off on temporarily curtailing nonessential operation, and a predefined state is invoked in which certain assets are shut down. 
Other situations might make use of an automated process. For example, based on threat intelligence received through monitoring activities (SITUATION-3f), a ruleset triggers an upgrade of the threat level, which triggers invocation of a predefined state that shuts down critical assets. Another example of predefined states of operations could be limiting communications between IT and OT environments during a cybersecurity incident. 
As another example, high-risk situations may be identified that warrant additional logging, such as a safety-related emergency that requires an immediate elevation of access privileges, but they also may increase the verbosity of logging on affected devices.

Technical controls may be necessary for third parties that supply a service like remote maintenance of an asset. The organization may also consider management controls like acquisitions strategies that obscure the end use of an asset.
The following are examples of the types of requirements to consider: 
· controls and procedures for granting access to third parties
· specifications for the governance, protection, and destruction of data 
· whether the supplier will be developing software, and if so what secure coding practices must be used
· the knowledge and skills needed to perform the responsibilities assigned to third parties
· cybersecurity training that may be necessary prior to granting access to third parties
· logging, log retention, and monitoring
· incident and vulnerability notification, mitigation, and response coordination including timelines and thresholds
· incident response and information sharing
· controls governing connections to organization systems by third parties
· whether a diversity of software, assets, and suppliers is necessary to lower the risk of broad exploitation of specific vulnerabilities
Sources of information for the development of cybersecurity requirements for suppliers include analysis of previous cyber events (internal, external and "near miss"), brainstorming with internal stakeholders, interviews with cybersecurity experts, industry threat alerts, vulnerability announcements, the results of internal control reviews, vulnerability assessments, penetration tests, and other research.

These should include the cybersecurity requirements that the organization expects the third party to meet. It is important that these specifications be thorough, detailed, definitive, adequate for use as criteria when selecting external entities, suitable as language in agreements with external entities, and appropriate for use as a basis for monitoring the performance of the third party. Ideally, legal and technical staff will work closely together in the development of these requirements. For example, technical staff may face challenges regarding configuration management when there is shared responsibility for the operation of assets. The organization may consider using contract language to ensure responsibility is properly assigned for addressing configuration issues.
Agreement language can be used to specify expectations and requirements for vulnerability or incident notification, including timelines, whether notification is required prior to public disclosure, and communication mechanisms to be used. Such specifications are often documented in service level agreements (SLAs) that are included in requests for proposals (RFPs). 
The agreement language should define what constitutes an event, incident, and vulnerability related to the delivery of the product or service. For example, a service outage in one region of the country that might affect other regions could be an event that the service provider should inform the organization about.

Additionally, these criteria should be clearly documented in the cybersecurity architecture or in a similar document. This helps those not privy to the original decision-making process understand why each criterion is needed. For example, OT assets that have unique characteristics (e.g., those that depend on insecure legacy software or have high availability requirements) may require a specific cybersecurity architecture design to achieve the operational goals of the organization. Additionally, organizations should consider standards and guidelines when planning for segmentation.

UPDATE [dbo].[MATURITY_QUESTIONS] SET [Supplemental_Info]=N'Network segmentation policies and controls refer to the strategies, guidelines, and technical measures that an organization establishes to divide its computer network into smaller, isolated segments or zones. The primary purpose of network segmentation is to improve security by containing threats, limiting lateral movement, and reducing the impact of potential security incidents:

Network Segmentation Policies:

Network segmentation policies are high-level guidelines that define how an organization plans and implements the division of its network into distinct segments or zones. These policies outline the goals, objectives, and principles of segmentation. They also address considerations like the types of data or services hosted in each segment, the access controls required, and the communication rules between segments.

Key aspects of network segmentation policies include:

Segmentation Strategy: This outlines the reasons for segmentation, such as security, regulatory compliance, or operational requirements.
Segment Identification: Defining which parts of the network will be segmented and identifying the criteria for segmenting (e.g., by department, function, sensitivity).
Access Controls: Specifying who has access to each segment and what level of access they have.
Communication Rules: Defining the rules for communication between segments, including which types of traffic are allowed or blocked.
Security Controls: Determining the security technologies and measures that will be employed within each segment.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Outlining how the segmented network will be monitored for security events and maintained over time.

Network Segmentation Controls:

Network segmentation controls encompass the technical measures and mechanisms used to enforce the policies and achieve the goals of network segmentation. These controls include:

Firewalls: Firewalls are devices or software applications that monitor and filter network traffic between segments based on predefined rules. They can block unauthorized communication and provide an additional layer of protection.

Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): IDPS solutions monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity. They can alert administrators or take automated actions to prevent attacks.

Virtual LANs (VLANs): VLANs create logical network segments within a physical network, allowing devices to be grouped based on criteria such as department or function.

Subnetting: Subnetting involves dividing IP address ranges into smaller subnets, effectively separating network traffic based on IP addresses.

Access Control Lists (ACLs): ACLs are rules that determine what traffic is allowed or denied at specific network points, such as routers or switches.

Network Isolation: Network isolation involves physically or logically separating segments to prevent unauthorized access.

It analyzes network packets, looking for patterns that match known attack signatures or anomalies that indicate potential threats. NIDS can provide real-time alerts or log events for further investigation by security administrators.

2. NIPS (Network Intrusion Prevention System): NIPS is an advanced version of NIDS that not only detects network intrusions but also takes proactive measures to prevent them. In addition to the detection capabilities of NIDS, NIPS has the ability to actively block or mitigate detected threats by dropping malicious packets, resetting connections, or implementing other defensive actions.

3. HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System): HIDS operates at the individual host level rather than monitoring network traffic. It monitors events occurring on a specific system, such as file modifications, logins, or system calls, to detect potential intrusions or unauthorized activities.

UPDATE [dbo].[MATURITY_QUESTIONS] SET [Supplemental_Info]=N'There are two main types of encryption algorithms: symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption (also known as public-key encryption):

• Symmetric Encryption: Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key to both encrypt and decrypt the data. The same key is used for both the encryption and decryption processes. This means that the sender and the receiver of the encrypted data must have a pre-shared secret key. Symmetric encryption algorithms, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), are generally faster and more efficient than asymmetric encryption algorithms. However, the challenge with symmetric encryption is securely distributing the shared key to all parties involved.

• Asymmetric Encryption: Asymmetric encryption involves the use of a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is widely distributed and used for encryption, while the private key is kept secret and used for decryption. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key and vice versa. Asymmetric encryption algorithms, such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), provide a secure method for encryption and decryption without requiring a pre-shared key. This makes asymmetric encryption suitable for scenarios where secure key distribution is a challenge or when secure communication channels are not established.

In practice, a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption is often used to achieve both efficiency and security. In secure communication protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security), asymmetric encryption is used initially to establish a secure channel and exchange a shared secret key. Once the shared key is established, symmetric encryption is used for the bulk of the data transmission due to its speed and efficiency.

Symmetric encryption uses a shared secret key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

Encryption algorithms ensure that data remains secure and confidential during transmission or storage by converting it into an unreadable format that can only be deciphered with the appropriate decryption key or algorithm.

Encryption algorithms operate on blocks of data, typically a fixed number of bits, and use cryptographic techniques to scramble the data into ciphertext. The level of security provided by an encryption algorithm depends on factors such as the complexity of the algorithm, the key size used, and the strength of the underlying cryptographic principles.

There are several well-known encryption algorithms:

• Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): AES is widely used and considered one of the most secure symmetric encryption algorithms. It supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits and operates on 128-bit blocks. AES has been adopted as a standard by the U.S. government for encrypting sensitive information.

• RSA: RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a pair of keys—a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is widely used for secure communication, key exchange, and digital signatures.

• Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES): 3DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that applies the older Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm three times in a row. While it is not as secure as AES, it is still used in legacy systems and certain applications.

• Rivest Cipher (RC) Algorithms: The RC algorithms, including RC4, RC5, and RC6, are symmetric encryption algorithms developed by Ronald Rivest. RC4, for example, is commonly used in wireless networks and secure sockets layer (SSL) protocols.

UPDATE [dbo].[MATURITY_QUESTIONS] SET [Supplemental_Info]=N'The principle of least privilege (PoLP) is a security concept that advocates granting users or processes only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their authorized tasks. This concept applies to both account management and access controls within an organization:

Account Management:

• User Accounts: When creating user accounts, the principle of least privilege suggests assigning the minimum necessary permissions required for users to carry out their job responsibilities effectively. This means avoiding granting excessive privileges or administrative rights that are not directly related to their roles. By adhering to the principle of least privilege during account creation, organizations reduce the risk of misuse, accidental data breaches, or intentional abuse of privileges.

• User Provisioning: During the provisioning process, organizations should follow the principle of least privilege by providing users with only the specific access rights and permissions required for their job functions. This ensures that users have access only to the systems, applications, and data that they need to perform their duties. Regular access reviews and recertifications should be conducted to ensure that user privileges remain appropriate and are adjusted as job roles change.

Access Controls:

• Authorization and Access Levels: Access controls should align with the principle of least privilege by granting access rights based on the principle of need-to-know. Users should only be granted access to the resources and data necessary to perform their tasks effectively. This minimizes the potential for accidental or intentional unauthorized access to sensitive information and reduces the impact of a security breach.

• Segmentation and Network Access: The principle of least privilege can be applied to network segmentation and access controls by implementing restrictions based on job roles or security classifications. By segmenting networks and restricting access to critical systems or sensitive data, organizations can limit exposure to potential attackers and reduce the impact of a compromised account or system.

• Privileged Access: Privileged accounts, such as administrative or system-level accounts, are particularly susceptible to misuse or compromise. Applying the principle of least privilege to privileged access management (PAM) ensures that only authorized individuals have elevated privileges and that those privileges are granted for specific tasks and limited periods.

In such cases, compensating controls are implemented to provide an additional layer of security and oversight:

1. Monitoring and Auditing: Compensating controls can include robust monitoring and auditing mechanisms that track and log the activities of privileged users or processes. This allows organizations to closely monitor the actions performed under elevated privileges, detect any suspicious or unauthorized activities, and respond promptly to potential security incidents.

2. Just-in-Time (JIT) Privilege Elevation: Rather than granting permanent elevated privileges to certain users or processes, compensating controls may involve implementing just-in-time privilege elevation. JIT privilege elevation allows temporary, time-limited access to elevated permissions when necessary. This ensures that users operate with the minimum necessary privileges most of the time and only obtain additional privileges for authorized tasks or a specific duration.

3. Two-Person Integrity (TPI): In some cases, compensating controls can involve requiring two or more authorized individuals to work together when performing critical or sensitive tasks that require elevated privileges.

UPDATE [dbo].[MATURITY_QUESTIONS] SET [Supplemental_Info]=N'Shared accounts, such as administrator or privileged accounts, are often required in organizations to perform various administrative or operational tasks. It is critical to enforce the principle of least privilege for shared accounts. The principle of least privilege dictates that users, including shared accounts, should only have the minimum privileges necessary to perform their intended tasks:

• Minimize Attack Surface: By applying the least privilege principle to shared accounts, the potential attack surface for adversaries is reduced. If shared accounts have excessive privileges, they become attractive targets for attackers. Limiting their privileges helps mitigate the risk of compromise and limits the potential impact of an attack.

• Prevent Unauthorized Access: Shared accounts typically have multiple users who require access to the account for specific purposes. Granting excessive privileges to shared accounts increases the likelihood of unauthorized access. By implementing least privilege, it ensures that each user only has the necessary permissions required for their specific role or task, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.

• Accountability and Auditing: When multiple users have access to a shared account, it becomes difficult to attribute specific actions to individual users. This can hinder accountability and make it challenging to identify the source of any malicious or unintended activities. By enforcing least privilege, unique user accounts are assigned to individuals, enabling better accountability and auditing capabilities.

• Limit Damage in Case of Compromise: If a shared account is compromised, an attacker can potentially leverage its high privileges to cause significant damage to the system or data. By applying the principle of least privilege, even if a shared account is compromised, the attacker''s ability to move laterally or escalate privileges within the system is limited, reducing the potential impact of a breach.

• Compliance Requirements: Many regulatory frameworks and industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), emphasize the principle of least privilege.

3. Training on Incident Response program/processes should be conducted separately from general awareness training and as part of the Incident Response program implementation. This includes training / awareness on identification of incidents and escalation protocols to ensure timely assessment as well as communications requirements (e.g., careful communications, avoid assumptions, no legal conclusions). 

4. Targeted security training and awareness campaigns should be defined for personnel with responsibilites for implementation of critical controls (e.g., patch management, secure system administration, threat monitoring and management).

Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute force attacks.

Establish a method to receive notifications about cyber threats that are actively targeting other organizations. The most effective way to do this is to join an information sharing and analysis organization (ISAO) or information sharing and analysis center (ISAC). Participating in an appropriate ISAO or ISAC is a great way to manage incident response. As directed by Executive Order 13691, when a member organization provides an ISAO with information about cyber-related breaches, interference, compromise, or incapacitation, the ISAO must:
• protect the individuals’ privacy and civil liberties,
• preserve business confidentiality, and
• safeguard the information being shared.
ISAOs and ISACs establish communities of professionals who are prepared to respond to the same cyber threats. By joining such a community, security and IT professionals bridge knowledge gaps with information provided by their peers via the ISAC/ISAO. ISACs and ISAOs tend to focus on a specific vertical (such as the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center [H-ISAC] within the health care sector) or community (such as the Population Health ISAO). In all cases, the primary function of these associations is to establish and maintain channels for sharing cyber intelligence.

The most effective way to do this is to join an information sharing and analysis organization (ISAO) or information sharing and analysis center (ISAC). Participating in an appropriate ISAO or ISAC is a great way to manage incident response. As directed by Executive Order 13691, when a member organization provides an ISAO with information about cyber-related breaches, interference, compromise, or incapacitation, the ISAO must:</p><p class="MsoNormal">&#8226; protect the individuals&#8217; privacy and civil liberties,</p><p class="MsoNormal">&#8226; preserve business confidentiality, and</p><p class="MsoNormal">&#8226; safeguard the information being shared.</p><p class="MsoNormal">ISAOs and ISACs establish communities of professionals who are prepared to respond to the same cyber threats. By joining such a community, security and IT professionals bridge knowledge gaps with information provided by their peers via the ISAC/ISAO.

Examples include installation of anti-theft cables, locks on rooms where the devices are located, and the use of badge readers to monitor access to rooms where devices are located.<br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>NIST Framework References</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>PR.AT-1:</b><i> All users are informed and trained&#160;</i><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The organization&#8217;s personnel and partners are provided cybersecurity awareness education and are trained to perform their cyber security related duties and responsibilities consistent with related policies, procedures, and agreements.</span><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>PR.IP-1:</b><i> A baseline configuration of information technology/industrial control systems is created and maintained incorporating security principles (e.g. concept of least functionality)</i><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Security policies (that address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination among organizational entities), processes, and procedures are maintained and used to manage protection of information systems and assets.</span><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>PR.AC-4: </b><i>Access permissions and authorizations are managed, incorporating the principles of least privilege and separation of duties</i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Access to physical and logical assets and associated facilities is limited to authorized users, processes, and devices, and is managed consistent with the assessed risk of unauthorized access to authorized activities and transactions.</span><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>PR.IP-12: </b><i>A vulnerability management plan is developed and implemented</i></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Security policies (that address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination among organizational entities), processes, and procedures are maintained and used to manage protection of information systems and assets.</span><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>PR.DS-1: </b><i>Data-at-rest is protected</i><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Information and records (data) are managed consistent with the organization&#8217;s risk strategy to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.</span><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>PR.DS-2:</b><i> Data-in-transit is protected</i><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Information and records (data) are managed consistent with the organization&#8217;s risk strategy to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.</span><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>PR.AC-3: </b><i>Remote access is managed</i><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Access to physical and logical assets and associated facilities is limited to authorized users, processes, and devices, and is managed consistent with the assessed risk of unauthorized access to authorized activities and transactions.</span><br></p>', N'Endpoint Protection Systems', N'Basic Endpoint Protection Controls', NULL, NULL, N'HHS405d', NULL, NULL, NULL, 60, NULL, NULL)

Enable Multifactor authentication for remote access - For devices that are accessed off site, leverage technologies that use multi-factor authentication before permitting users to access data or applications on the device. Logins that use only a username and password are often compromised through phishing e-mails.
If your organization leverages an EHR system or accesses sensitive data through application systems (either on the cloud or on site), encrypt network access to these applications. Contracts with EHR vendors should include language that requires medical/PHI data to be encrypted both at rest and during transmission between systems. Encryption applications prevent hackers from accessing sensitive data, usually by requiring a “key” to encrypt and/or decrypt data.
Finally, educate your employees on the need to report the loss or theft of any endpoints within their control to the appropriate team inside the organization. For example, if a backpack with a laptop is stolen at an airport, the employee should report the theft promptly to the organizational leadership.
